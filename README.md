# Serve_Request_System_Project_management
 ChatGPT In this project, I acted as a Project Manager, leading a team of six developers on the "Serve Request System (SRS)" project, which is a mobile application for service providers. Disclaimer: I did not build an actual app; the focus was on managing the project through the Agile lifecycle, including sprints, cost, and profit analysis.
